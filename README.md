# cpp-Neat

This is an implimentation of NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) which is a genetic machine learning algorithm. It works be creating really simple neural networks and then randomly mutating them and  combining the most successfull networks via mating to spread their mutations across a species. There are species that divide the population to make sure that no one type of network dominates. In my specific implementation networks are also trained using backpropagation to discover  their true potential at the cost of time. However, this could easily be changed to strictly follow the pure form.The base case for testing is a continous xor which isn't very challenging. This is fully tested with limitted multithreading. There is also an incredibly basic hpc branch that works with MPI.
